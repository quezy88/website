        <p>
          Hello and Welcome! My name is Jenny and I'm full-stack software developer with a passion for creating appealing digital experiences. 
          I specialize in making simple, user-friendly websites that are pleasing to the eye, easy to navigate, and highly functional.
        </p>
        <p>
          I primarily work with small businesses and individual clients in a deeply collaborative and iterative approach. 
          My previous background as a brand and PR consultant gives me a unique 
          perspective on how to bring the ethos of my clients' brand to digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          My toolkit inlcudes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL/Sequelize and Firebase, as well as Vercel for deployement. And I'm always happy to learn new tools to get your website just right!
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a small business needing a website for your products/services or an individual looking to showcase your portfolio, I'd love to work with you. 
        </p>
